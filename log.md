# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: February 10, 2025

Today’s Progress: Created a small HTML page with some things I learned from a tutorial not too long ago. I worked with a div border box, learned about <span style="color: blue;">HTTP</span>, <span style="color: blue;">HTML</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">DNS</span>.

Thoughts: Learned some fundamentals and enjoyed practicing new concepts.

## Day 2: February 11, 2025

Today’s Progress: Learned a lot about the Command Line Interface (CLI) and practiced using it. Integrated a ‘ToolTip’ into a paragraph in HTML for my self-assignment.

Thoughts: The CLI commands are super useful, and I’ve made some progress understanding them.

## Day 3: February 12, 2025

Today’s Progress: Continued working on the CLI. Memorized more commands and practiced them.  

Thoughts: The more I use the CLI, the more efficient I’ll become.

## Day 4: February 13, 2025

Today’s Progress: Learned more about HTML and worked with @ChatGPTapp and @MSFTCopilot to build a cool HTML CLI simulation app. Practiced typing regular commands.

Thoughts: I’m improving my command memorization and building useful tools with HTML.

## Day 5: February 14, 2025

Today’s Progress: Practiced and reviewed what I’ve learned. Worked with AI models and explored ASCII escape codes.  

Thoughts: The more I practice, the more I understand. I’m gaining confidence every day.

## Day 8: February 17, 2025

Today’s Progress: Made cool HTML animations, followed a guide, tried new things with AI, and tinkered with my own projects. I created a cascading effect with HTML and CSS.

Thoughts: It’s great experimenting with new effects and seeing the results come to life.

## Day 9: February 18, 2025

Today’s Progress: Worked on generating div boxes wiht different colors.
Demonstrated the 'overflow' property on two containers, one with it and one without, to showcase the effect.

Thoughts: Learned how this can affect the visual outcome on the screen and how placment of paragraphs matters if using nesting within a div that's hiding the overflow (and would hide the would be paragraph too!)

## Day 10: February 19, 2025

Today’s Progress: Worked on figuring out how to link nested html pages and images together in file system.

Thoughts: This was my first time doing this and it was a good conceptual exercise because I think most websites will use a similar structure in how they link pages and resources.
