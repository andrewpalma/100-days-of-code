					I did this all in a normal text editor just to make sure I have the fundamentals down. I am still fresh/new to all of this so doing it 'the hard way' actually helps. And when I learn something new I'll try to share it in my upcoming #100DayChallenge projects too, that way anyone who comes across this can use it to learn something new too!

					So this is using the "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" Paragraph Element...
					
				</p>
				<p>
					Beginning: So this the beginning of the same paragraph and I'm going to put a break "&lt;br&gt;" here in the HTML code to demonstrate a break... here it comes: <br>... see how the paragraph is now broken up into two on the screen/page? But the cool part is in the HTML code it's still part of the same paragraph because it's within the same PAIR of opening and closing tags, just for clarity they look like this: "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
				</p>
				<p title="See... I told you so! This is a tooltip!">
					So this is using something called a 'tooltip' which I just learned about! Hover your cursor over this paragraph <span>FOR A FEW SECONDS</span> to see it for yourself!
